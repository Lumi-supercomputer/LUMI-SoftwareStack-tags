tag 20250227: Minor updates to the contributed EasyConfigs

-   PLUMED 2.9.2 updated to 2.9.3, and the same with packages that
    depend on it.
-   Bugfix in one of the PETSc recipes.
-   Independent from these repositories, but Spack modules are no longer
    indexed by module spider unless explicitly requested or the module is
    loaded while the cache is being build.

Procedure: See the LUST Wiki
