tag 20230308: Enhancements to the central stack and updates of contributed packages

-   rocm/5.4.6 for CrayEnv and LUMI/23.09 as there are too many problems with rocm/5.6.1.
-   EasyBuild-tools loaded by the EasyBuild module in 23.09, to add additional tools that
    EasyBuild expects to find but are missing in the system image.
-   JAX container modules.
-   Improved documentation for the PyTorch containers.
-   Initial steps to offer containers that support a Python virtual environment for 
    adding packages out-of-the-box.
-   Updates to Quantum ESPRESSO, GROMACS, NAMD and PETSc, the latter two now also with GPU support.
